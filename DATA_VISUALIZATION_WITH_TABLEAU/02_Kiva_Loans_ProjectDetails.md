## Kiva Loans Dashboard (Project - 2)
### Overview
Kiva is an international nonprofit, founded in San Francisco. Kiva's mission is to expand financial access to help underserved communities thrive. Kiva is not a donation organization, but a loan organization. The below steps simply shows how Kiva works:
1. A borrower applies for a loan.
2. The loan goes through the underwriting and approval process.
3. Loan is posted to Kiva for lenders to support.
4. Fundraising period starts. Lenders crowdfund the loan in increments of $25 or more. Fundraising completed.
5. Borrower repays the loan.
6. Lenders use repayments to fund new loans, donate or withdraw the money.

### Objective
You're working as a business intelligence analyst in Kiva. You have been asked to create a dashboard that will help analyze how loans are being provided globally. This needs to be an interactive dashboard which will help answer the following questions:
* What is the most represented gender among loan applicants by country?
* How does the loan amount for a select group of countries compare to the global total?
* How are loan amounts distributed by sector? Globally? For the select group of countries?
* What is the gender split in loan applicants for the select group of countries?

### Dataset

    <b>‚òùImportant:</b> The dataset is a large dataset and may need extra computing time when creating views in Tableau depending on your computer's hardware spesifications. In case you have problem to create the viz due to hardware, apply Data Source filter to the <b>posted_time></b> filter and select 2014 and 2015 years.
